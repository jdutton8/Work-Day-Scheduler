# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
Using starter code provided, I created a simple work day scheduler. This planner allows the user to input their daily schedule and save it to local storage. The time blocks change color depending on the time. Past time blocks will turn grey, future time blocks are green, and the current time block is red.
